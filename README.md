# Goal
This repo documents my approach to building LLMs from the ground up using basic Numpy and PyTorch.

Later, I'll go deep into the LLM training pipeline, starting from data loading and culminating in finetuning LLMs on custom datasets.
This is supported by the [Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) book by Sebastian Raschka.
